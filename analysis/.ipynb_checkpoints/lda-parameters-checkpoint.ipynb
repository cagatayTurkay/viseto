       "0   As a Latino man. I will NEVER support a racist bigot... PERIOD!\\n#Dumptrump. This country does not need or want establishment politicians or establishment media deciding our fate any longer. Senator Sanders one of your mistakes as a politician was to trust politicians (DNC). Your second mistake is to trust Hillary. Your Third mistake is to encourage us to do the same.You may be right about wasting a protest vote. I live in a red state. It is red in part because of Clinton policies and politicians and parties spending most of their time pandering to corporate America and waiting to get the vote out until it is too late. The parties and elected officials do nothing to educate people at the street level and encourage people to become involved in the political process through voting. My vote is going for Jill. That's an easy decision for me. My state unfortunately is very red. I do not think I could vote for Hillary regardless. So please do not blame the voters. Blame the politicians, ...   \n",

The party of Andrew Jackson (slave owner and mass murderer of Native Americans) hasn't changed in their message....only in their delivery.  \\n\\nWhen the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments were passed to end slavery, Democrats implemented Jim Crow Laws.  When those failed, they created the KKK to suppress blacks from voting and running for office.  When that failed, the highest politically ranking KKK member (Pres. Wilson) implemented segregation laws.  And when that failed, they leveraged the CRA as a way to con black into thinking that the Democrat party has done a 180° change of heart....when instead all they did was repackage their pro-slavery mentality into a more palatable version.  This is known as \"From 40ac & A Mule To 50yrs Of Failure\"\\n\\nHow is this supported?  Simple, when you look at predominantly black communities over the last 50yrs you find two results.
